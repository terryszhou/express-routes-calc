Your task for this lab is create a webserver calculator using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) routes. Your calculator should handle **GET** (`app.get()`) requests to `/add`, `/subtract`, `/multiply` and `/divide`. You should use *URL parameters* to handle requests to your calculator.

Example using URL parameters:

route | response
------|---------|
`/add/:x/:y` | responds with x + y
`/subtract/:x/:y` | responds with x - y
`/multiply/:x/:y` | responds with x * y
`/divide/:x/:y` | responds with x / y

This is an example of a simple GET route with request parameters using express:

```javascript
app.get('/:input', (req, res) => {
  console.log("req.params: ", req.params)
  res.send("Our parameter is " + req.params.input + ".");
});
```

## Getting Started

* fork and clone this repo and then cd in into express-routes-calc
* run `npm init` to initialize a node project
* run `npm i express` to install the required packages
* `touch index.js` to create the main entry point for your express app
* use `nodemon` to run your express app

Before writing your routes, set up a simple express app with a `hello world` route to test that everything is working.

<summary> HELP! I'm stuck setting up an express app! </summary>

Check out this pseudocode, it might help:

```javascript
// import required modules

// configure express app

// define routes

// listen on a port
```
</details>

<summary> Stop Messing Around! I'm really stuck!! </summary>

This is an example of the most simple express server:

```javascript
// import required modules
const express = require('express')

// configure express app
const app = express()
const PORT = 3000

// define routes
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

// listen on a port
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`listening to the smooth sounds of port ${PORT} in the morning 🌊`)
})
```
</details>

## Bonus

Make it so your calculator can accept any amount of numbers to do math with instead of just 2 hardcoded ones with the wildcard `*` route variable.

Use this example at `/wildcard/*` to experiment with how this might work:

```javascript
app.get("/wildcard/*", (req, res) => {
  res.send(req.params);
});
```
